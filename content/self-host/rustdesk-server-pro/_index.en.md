### Hardware requirement

Lowest level VPS is enough for your use case. The server software is not CPU and memory intensive. Our public ID server hosted on a 2 CPU/4 GB Vultr server serves 1.5+ million endpoints.

### Video tutorials

There are many video tutorials available online that can guide you through installing the OSS version, https://rustdesk.com/docs/en/self-host/rustdesk-server-oss/install/#video-tutorials.

The installation of the Pro version is almost identical, except for the following differences:

- Different download path and Docker images are required.
- An additional TCP port (21114) is needed for the web console.
